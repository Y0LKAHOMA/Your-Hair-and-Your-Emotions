## Age and Hair Style Choice and its Influence on Peoples’ Emotion

### Abstract
This study investigated how age and hair styling choices influence individuals’ emotions. Previous research has explored hair-related attitudes across broad age groups and styling preferences, we explore two independent variables: age and style choice. I hypothesized that younger individuals would exhibit more positive emotions, as natural hair and protective styles are more widely accepted today. Additionally, I predict that those with styled hair would experience more favorable emotions compared to those with unstyled hair. Participants (N=40, ages 13+) completed self-report measures assessing their hair-related emotions, age, and styling choices. Results revealed no significant relationship between age and hair-related emotions (β=-0.47, p=0.148), between styling choices and emotions (β=0.11, p=0.609), and lastly between
age, styling choices, and emotions (p=.302). Deeper research and findings may inform
interventions and initiatives focused on promoting positive self-perception and fostering inclusive societal norms
